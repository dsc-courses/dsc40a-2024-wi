Hi, I am Yutian (Skylar) Shi. I am a rising junior majoring in Data Science and minoring in Photography 📷 from China. DSC40a is one of my favorite courses and it helps me to understand materials in later courses :) Hope you will also have fun in this course! A fun fact: I am a self-proclaimed ping-pong lover that plays once a year 🏓️.
