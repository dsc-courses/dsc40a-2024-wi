Hello, I’m Janine and I am excited to be teaching DSC 40A this quarter! I’m originally from New Jersey but I moved to San Diego over ten years ago for grad school at UCSD 🔱, where I studied combinatorics in the Math department. Since then, I've taught courses in Computer Science, Math, and Data Science.  I love DSC 40A because it gives you a sense of the power of data science in solving real-world problems and it shows you interesting applications of all that math you’ve spent so many years learning! Outside of teaching, I love playing board games, crafting, hiking, and baking epic desserts! 🧁
